     Note: this is different from ctrl + drag from button to viewController.
     
     note: If you had other screens you could do
     an if-Else-statement with same codes & different identifier.
     
     Why do segue programatically:
     UI Segue can't be debug with debbuger step in, through etc.
     Also some employer has stric coding standard thet wants code
     instead of interface builder.
     
     This prog segue always requires an Identifier
